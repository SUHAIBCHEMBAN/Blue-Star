            Air pollution has been a subject of focus recently, and interestingly indoor air quality is worse than the air outdoors in many cases due to closed environments that trap pollutants and micro-organisms. Blue Star’s range of elegant and contemporary Air Purifiers packed with advanced features such as SensAir and nanoeTM or Plasma technologies, supported by a multi-stage filtration process, helps keep the air in homes pure, clean and healthy.</p>
